# Comlink Two-Way IFrame React App

This is a basic React app that uses [Comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink) to set up a two-way communication channel between child iframes and the parent window.

The goal is to be able to have many iframes talking to the parent, so that they could potentially request that actions or events occur in the main window.
